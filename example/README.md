# Example Script

This is a really, really simple little Node project that just demonstrates how to use `field-caser` with TypeScript.

To run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn example
```

That's it.  You will see this in the console:

```
User was { first_name: 'Homer', last_name: 'Simpson' } User is now { firstName: 'Homer', lastName: 'Simpson' }
```
